# white-matter-components
This repository includes the white matter dynamic functional component maps obtained by applying group ICA at three different cardinalities (10n, 20n and 100n) to track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity maps of 423 healthy subjects from two different large-scale multimodal imaging datasets. 

Further details on how the statistical maps were obtained can be found in the reference paper:
